# RestingBlocks

RestingBlocks is a little spigot plugin to give you a smart way to rest. With RB you can specify any block in your minecraft world as RB. After that, you can add effects to that RB like instant_health or regeneration.  

# Commands 
## addRest
"addRest" will define the block you are standing on as RestingBlock. You can then configure the saturation and regeneration lvl in the config. 
## delRest
With "delRest" you can delete the RB you are standing on.
